# Telomerase MyTown2 Protection Files 

These are MyTown2 protection files for Terrafirmacraft+ and the Telomerase modpack. These protection files are used on the Delightful Telomerase server. Feel free to use these for your own servers. To use the files, drop them into config/MyTown/protections.

Most of the protection files were modified from the original versions at https://github.com/MyEssentials/MyTown2-Protections/
